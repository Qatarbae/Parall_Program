# OPENMP, CUDA, MPI, OPENCL

OPENMP - Any number n greater than one generates a sequence of the form:
ni+1 = (ni % 2 == 0? ni / 2 : 3 * ni + 1), the last element of which is 1 (for example: 13->40->20->10->5->16->8->4->2->1). Find the largest number, smaller than the given N, that generates the longest such sequence.

CUDA - Inverse matrix

OPENCL = Find the smallest number n greater than a given N, for which the sum of any of its divisors d with the result of division n/d is a prime number (this is the number 30, which has divisors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)
